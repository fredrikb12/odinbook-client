## Reflections

As this is the final project of the whole Node path, it's very large in scale. You are to build a front-end that communicates with an API (that you've built), displays the data fetched, and ideally does this in a very streamlined way allowing for a comfortable user experience.

I felt relatively comfortable writing the code for the back-end this time, as much of it is repetition from previous projects; making posts and comments in the Blog project, handling authentication in the Members Only project, etc. That being said, the data model relationships were significantly more complicated this time around, which required a lot of work to handle.

The front-end development process went relatively smoothly, and I appreciate the back and forth you can get into when your project reaches that point. You try to implement a feature on the front-end, realize something has to change in the back-end, implement that change in the code and it all comes together very nicely. It's a great iterative process, and I enjoy that a lot.

I was originally intending to look into both socket.io for direct messaging, and reading into how one might implement video calls, however the overall scope and complexity of the project was already large enough, by the time I finished the core functionality I felt happy with the result. Something worth keeping in mind for the future!
